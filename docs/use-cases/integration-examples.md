# Integration Examples

This document provides real-world examples of integrating MCP-GitLab into various environments and workflows.

## Example 1: Continuous Integration Pipeline

**Scenario**: A development team wants to automate testing and deployment for their microservices.

### Setup
- **Tools Used**: GitLab CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up a `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration for automated builds.
  2. Integrate Docker to containerize the application.
  3. Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster after successful tests.

### Sample Configuration
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker build -t my-image:$CI_COMMIT_SHA .
  tags:
    - docker

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
  tags:
    - k8s
```

## Example 2: Automated Code Review

**Scenario**: A team wants to enforce coding standards and ensure all code is reviewed before merging.

### Setup
- **Tools Used**: MCP, GitLab, ESLint
- **Steps**:
  1. Configure MCP to listen for merge request events.
  2. Use ESLint to analyze code as part of the CI pipeline.
  3. Automatically assign reviewers based on code ownership.

### Sample Configuration
```yaml
review:
  enabled: true
  rules:
    - match: "src/**/*.js"
      reviewers:
        - js-team

linting_stage:
  script:
    - eslint src/**/*.js --fix
```

## Example 3: Security Scanning

**Scenario**: A financial company needs to ensure robust security by scanning for vulnerabilities before deployment.

### Setup
- **Tools Used**: Trivy, GitLab CI/CD
- **Steps**:
  1. Integrate Trivy into the CI pipeline to scan Docker images.
  2. Fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
  3. Notify the security team for remediation.

### Sample Configuration
```yaml
security_scan:
  stage: test
  image:
    name: aquasec/trivy
  script:
    - trivy image my-image:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
  allow_failure: false
```

## Conclusion

These examples demonstrate how MCP-GitLab can be integrated into various existing workflows to enhance automation, enforce compliance, and improve efficiency.
