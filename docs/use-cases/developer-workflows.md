# Developer Workflows

This document provides insight into various developer workflows designed to enhance productivity with the MCP-GitLab integration.

## Introduction

The integration of MCP with GitLab facilitates streamlined development processes, enabling developers to focus more on coding and less on administrative overhead.

## Basic Workflow

### üõ† **Setup and Configuration**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dev-mcp-gitlab
   cd dev-mcp-gitlab
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run Dev Environment**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Connect to GitLab**
   - Configure the `.env` file with GitLab credentials.

### üìå **Daily Development**
1. **Feature Branching**
   - Create feature branches prefixed with `feature/`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
   ```
2. **Regular Commits**
   - Commit changes frequently with meaningful messages.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "[#issue] Add initial implementation"
   ```
3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Push changes to trigger CI pipelines.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/awesome-feature
   ````

## Code Review Workflow

### üîÑ **Pull Request Process**
1. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Use PR templates provided in the `.github` directory.
   ```markdown
   # Pull Request

   **Issue Reference**: Closes #issue

   **Description**
   Briefly explain rationale and impact of changes.
   ```
2. **Automated Checks**
   - Ensure all checks pass including tests and style.

3. **Reviewer Assignment**
   - Assign reviewers and request feedback.

4. **Address Feedback**
   - Make necessary changes and update the PR.

5. **Merge and Deploy**
   - Once approved, merge using `Squash and merge`.

## Advanced Workflow

### üîÑ **Branching Strategy**
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Frequent merges to the main branch.
- **Git Flow**: Utilize feature, develop, and hotfix branches.

### üìä **CI/CD Enhancements**
- **Automated Tests**: Run tests in CI for every commit.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Utilize tools like ESLint, Prettier.

## Troubleshooting

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Common Issues**
1. **Merge Conflicts**
   - Occur when parallel branches modify the same lines.
   - **Solution**: Manually resolve in GitLab UI or CLI.

2. **Failed CI Jobs**
   - May fail due to compilation errors or lint issues.
   - **Solution**: Check logs, fix errors, and rerun jobs.

3. **Code Reviews Delayed**
   - Waiting on reviews can slow progress.
   - **Solution**: Communicate with team, prioritize code reviews.

## Conclusion

Leveraging MCP-GitLab workflows effectively enhances development agility and productivity. The integration supports various branching strategies, CI/CD practices, and collaborative tools to foster a seamless development experience.
